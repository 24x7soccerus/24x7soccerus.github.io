<p>My name is Jack. I am 8 years old and I love to play soccer. My favorite player is Lionel Messi. When I grow up I want to be a professional soccer player.</p>

<p>On April 1, 2014 (when I was still 7), I started a juggle journal to track how many juggles I can get in a row. Before I started my juggle journal my record was 203 juggles in a row. In the first three weeks I broke my record six times. I tracked my juggles daily for about four months.</p> 

<p><strong>I got up to 2,266 juggles in a row!</strong></p>

<p>Here is a video of me juggling during my first week of April 2014.</p>

<p>I juggled for at least 15 minutes every day and wrote down my highest number of juggles I got in a row and added them to this site. I almost always used my feet and tried to switch between my left and right foot each time. I could juggle about 100 times in a minute.</p>

<p>I love to juggle a soccer ball. It helps with my touch and gives me lots of confidence playing soccer. I hope I can help other kids to start juggle journals and track their juggles too.</p>
