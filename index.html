<p>My name is Jack. I am 8 years old and I love to play soccer. My favorite player is Lionel Messi. When I grow up I want to be a professional soccer player.</p>

<p>On February 21, 2015, I started a project where I record myself playing soccer - with just a ball and a wall. Don't get me wrong, I love to play soccer with my friends, my family, and with my soccer club, but I also love to just find a wall and knock the ball around. I can find a wall anywhere - inside a gym, the side of a building, even the bottom of my couch!</p> 

<p>By using just a ball and a wall, I can pretty much play soccer anywhere and practice pretty much every technical part of soccer - passing, receiving, shooting, etc. The wall gives me instant feedback and really helps me with my touch.</p>

<p>The plan is to post a recording at least once a week showing me using just a ball and a wall. I hope I can encourage others to take out their ball, find a wall, and enjoy the beautiful game of soccer!</p>

<p>This is me in my living room using my couch as a wall! It's been really cold and snowy. The couch and a size one ball makes me really concentrate because the space is tight, the ball is smaller, and it comes off the couch different almost everytime.</p>

<p>Last year, I had a different project where I juggled for at least 15 minutes a day and tracked my highest number of juggles in a row each day. I reached over 2,200 juggles in a row with my feet!. Take a look at my <a href="http://soccerjuggles.com">Juggle Journal.</a></p>
