<p>My name is Jack. I am 8 years old and I love to play soccer. My favorite player is Lionel Messi. When I grow up I want to be a professional soccer player.</p>

<p>On February 21, 2015, I started a project where I record myself playing soccer - with just a ball and a wall. Don't get me wrong, I love to play soccer with my friends, my family, and with my soccer club, but I also love to just find a wall and knock the ball around.</p> 

<p>By using just a ball and a wall, I can pretty much play soccer anywhere and practice pretty much every part of soccer - passing, receiving, shooting, etc. The wall gives me instant feedback and really helps me with my touch</p>

<p>The plan is to post a recording at least once a week showing me using just a ball and a wall. I hope I can encourage others to take out their ball, find a wall, and enjoy the beautiful game of soccer!</p>

<p>Here is a video of me with just a ball and a wall on the first day of this project.</p>
